#enable url rewriting
RewriteEngine on

#Force all requests to go via the public folder
RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$
RewriteRule (.*) /public/$1 [L]

# Note the redirect status rule prevents htaccess loop because the nested htaccess redirect back to the /index.php in this folder.
#   Hence there is an index.php in this folder including the nested one we really want.
#       require_once __DIR__ . '/public/index.php';
#   Not the nest solution but onyl way I have right now when host forced me to put the whole project inside a public html folder.
