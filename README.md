# Hi there üëã
Decided to turn my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/b-hayes/b-hayes) repo into a functioning website.
**Check it out @ [b-hayes.com](https://b-hayes.com).**

It includes a simple routing solution I designed in an afternoon and my favourite htaccess setup.

Content is generated from my Github README.md file using a small library I found called [erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)
that turns markdown into HTML.

There is also some nifty CSS to sync with your operating system's dark mode üòé

It is simple yet effective and embodies some of my [core principles](public/articles/BOPs.md).
Also checkout [Exception an Error Handling in PHP](public/articles/2021-04-13-exception-and-error-handling-in-php.md).

## Where is this going?
Mainly just providing some info and links to my hobby projects.

I will put some thoughts down into other MD files to link to from here so this site has more pages to generate.

Experimental ideas approaching common solutions
will likely appear in the backend since I love building
things from scratch in PHP.

Templates, prototypes and other example code that may
have no real purpose other than for the fun of writing code.

I love writing code and never stop doing it.

In the past, I have not published or shown much of my projects to anyone and figured I need to share and be more open.

This might even encourage me to publish some of them for people to use.

## Projects I am working on.
I have a bunch of crazy ideas and not much time to work on them so right now it's just...
I'll list some more if I get time to put my older stuff online somewhere,
or I may just build new things instead üòÅ

### [This project.](https://b-hayes.com)
I need the rendered content to be prettier to look at.
Currently, it has dark and light mode detection and that's it.

## [CLI Package](https://github.com/b-hayes/cli).
Turns any PHP class into a command-line application.
