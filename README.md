# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Decided to turn my github profile repo into a functioning website.
**Check it out at [h-hayes.com](h-hayes.com)!**

It includes simple routing solution I designed in an afternoon and my favorite htaccess setup.
Content is generated from this MD file using a small library I found called [erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)

Its simple yet effective and embodies core principles with Php Development.
See if you can figure out what those principles are ðŸ¤”

## What I am currently working.
This project.

## Other Projects.
Checkout my awesome [CLI Package](https://github.com/b-hayes/cli) that turns your PHP class into a command line application.
