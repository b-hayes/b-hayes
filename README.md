# Hi there 👋
Decided to turn my [Github profile](https://github.com/b-hayes/b-hayes) repo into a functioning website.
**Check it out @ [h-hayes.com](h-hayes.com)!**

It includes simple routing solution I designed in an afternoon and my favorite htaccess setup.

Content is generated from this MD file using a small library I found called [erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)
that turns markdown into html.

There is some nifty css that changes the page into dark mode with your operating system 😎

Its simple yet effective and embodies some of my [core principles](/articles/BOPs.md).

## Where is this going?
Mainly just providing some info and links to my hobby projects.
Perhaps some concepts, templates and experimental/prototype example code that have no
real purpose other than for the fun of writing code.

I love writing code and never stop doing it.

In the past I've not published or shown much of my personal projects to anyone and figured I need to share more and
actually publish some web apps and games.

I might come up with some more blogs to fill out the site a bit.

## What I am currently working.
### [This project.](b-hayes.com)
I am probably going to play around with the routing some more and set this up as a basic template for some
API + VueJS project ideas to move on to next.

I really want the rendered MD file to be prettier.

Currently, it has dark and light mode detection in css tho try it out by changing your OS colour scheme and the page
should update accordingly. 😎

## Other Projects.
Checkout my awesome [CLI Package](https://github.com/b-hayes/cli) that turns your PHP class into a command line application.

I'll list some more if I get time to put my old stuff online somewhere.
