# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Decided to turn my github profile repo into a functioning website.
**Check it out at [h-hayes.com](h-hayes.com)!**

It includes simple routing solution I designed in an afternoon and my favorite htaccess setup.
Content is generated from this MD file using a small library I found called [erusev/parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown)

Its simple yet effective and embodies core principles with Php Development.
See if you can figure out what those principles are ðŸ¤”

## Where is this going?
Mainly just providing some info and links to my hobby projects I do for fun and show of some basic concepts in code.

Content will probably all be generated from MD files with some basic CSS to petty it up.

Backend might fill out a lot more as I do love building custom PHP from scratch and perhaps
this might become a base template for future projects.

In the past I've not published or shown much of my personal projects to anyone and figured I need to share more and
actually publish some web apps and games.

## What I am currently working.
### [This project.](b-hayes.com)
I am probably going to play around with the routing some more and set this up as a basic template for some
API + VueJS project ideas to move on to next.

I really want the rendered MD file to be prettier.

Currently, it has dark and light mode detection in css tho try it out by changing your OS colour scheme and the page
should update accordingly. ðŸ˜Ž

## Other Projects.
Checkout my awesome [CLI Package](https://github.com/b-hayes/cli) that turns your PHP class into a command line application.

I'll list some more if I get time to put my old stuff online somewhere.
